        personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>

            <li>Return a list of ALL movies to the user</li>
            <li>Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it's featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user</li>
            <li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title</li>
            <li>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</li>
            <li>Allow new users to register</li>
            <li>Allow users to update their user info</li>
            <li>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites</li>
            <li>Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites</li>
            <li>Allow existing users to deregister.</li>
